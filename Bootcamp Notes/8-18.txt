Bootstrap notes
-grids are "There is no one who loves pain itself, who seeks after it and wants to have it, 
-using parent and siblings you can have text remaion in the same row as its image/thumbnail
- Grid rows when you want a colomn to be a certain amount of the row if the row is 6 and you want the col to = half the row it would read col-3 because the total is 12 but the row is set for 6
-Bootstrap assumes theres 12 possible columns
<div class="col-md-12">
*spans full width of container because bootstrap max columns is 12
<div> class="col-md-4">
*spans 1/3 of the width of the page.
-every bootstrap grid
-containers:holds the col/rows and content. organized by class
-rows:horizontal boxes holding content. (no limit on how many rows)
-columns:vertical boxes holding content; only functions in a container
