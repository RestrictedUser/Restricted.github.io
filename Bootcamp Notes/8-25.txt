functions

bigArray.forEach(function (hero) {
    console.log(hero);
})
forEach is a predetermined function that will run for loops on a array

*EX.         below is functions name
function changeBrowser(){
                    -- in here we add function code/content
console.log(x+y+z);
            
};

myFunction(arguement){
--inside the () is where the function has its arguement
};

METHODS
invoking/calling a function as a method
In JavaScript you can define functions as object methods.

The following example creates an object (myObject), with two properties (firstName and lastName), and a method (fullName):

var myObject = {
    firstName:"John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    fullName: function () {
        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
    }
}
myObject.fullName();         // Will return "John Doe"

EX. of object:
var gandalf = {
      "real name": "Gandalf",
      "age (est)": 11000,
      "race": "Maia",
      "haveRetirementPlan": true,
      "aliases": [
        "Greyhame",
        "Stormcrow",
        "Mithrandir",
        "Gandalf the Grey",
        "Gandalf the White"
      ]
    };

    how to declare a function driveToWork that is an object or inside one
    always declare the object that the function is coming from
    ex. when var = car and a function is a condition of the var oject car then
    we use car.driveToWork(); to run the function.


    Scope:
    Importance of putting the code inside to correct set of {} because if they are not included the functions inside the {}scope wont be accesible.
