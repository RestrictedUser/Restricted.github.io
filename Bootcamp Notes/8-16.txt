CSS
div{
    margin:0 auto;
    text-aligh:center;
}
* The margin setting allows the text-align to center the div.

-line height: distance between lines of text on a page(golden ratio of 1.5x font)
-font-size: actual size of lettering. Should be at least 16px

-line length: nos css property but rather a standard. 
Should be about 50-75 charcters per line on a desktop.

- letter spacing: spacing between individual letters

-sans-Serif vs serif: sans-serif are fonts sans their serifs--no  tails.

-tails: the tail that comes off the end of the lettering in texts

-leading: space between blocks of text.

-Google Fonts:<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Poppins" rel="stylesheet"> 

-Pseudo Classes: keywords that can be added to cause mouse actions
(normally used for links)
+Default state:
+Hover state:Text enlarges when mouse passes over
+Focus state: Cursor is sent to this field and remains there whether mouse moves.
+Active state:Changes the state of the button when when moused over ex. input a password to press enter.

ex.
a:hover {

    background-color:red;
}
*The mouse only changes style when the mouse is hovered over the link because it has the hover state.

a:active {

    background-color:red;
}
*Active state only completes the style when the mouse is clicked. When the mouse is released it looses the applied style/state.
