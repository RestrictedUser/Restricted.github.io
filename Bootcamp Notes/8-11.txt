-html/css go in seperate files but the same folder.

Positioning
-Static: positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.
-relative: positions relative to its parent
-absolute: Positioning native to nearest ancestor
-fixed: based on browser window ex. pop ups that stay fixed in center whether you scroll away
-z-index: allows you to layer elements on top of each other when they're positioned
ex. z-index: 100; vs z-index: 101; the element with the z-index of 101 comes to the top.
-hiding elements: display: none; (hides element from view) visibility:hidden; ()

hint: try doing flex box froggy again for practice
