Flow notes
-Span: tells html this goes onto the next line like div
-colspan: collum version of Span
-float: text moves around the element. Makes other elements flow around it.
-positioning: up/down/left/right
-every element is basically a div with more defining qualities
-class: apply to multiple elements 
-id: singular element
-reset.css: reset.css allows you to see reset html and work from a baseline to make it work on all browsers
you would have to re-style css but it would make it cross-browser compatible.
